# Manager JDK
## Requirements
Need Operating System Windows with architecture 64Bit
## Instalation
To install the Manager, it is only necessary to execute the file [`install.bat`](https://github.com/anewri32/mjdk/blob/main/install.bat) or execute the following instruction in the console or terminal:
```commandline
setx MJDK_HOME %cd%
setx PATH "%PATH%";"%MJDK_HOME%"

The terminal must be located in the location where Manager JDK was downloaded.

## Use
